# IODP site updates
Update proposed, scheduled, and completed drilling sites using Python and output Excel files for KML conversion

## Instructions
This notebook walks you through the process of updating 3 Excel files our office regularly updates:

- Proposed sites
- Scheduled expeditions
- Recently completed expeditions

The information needed to do this task is spread across several tables on the [IODP website](https://www.iodp.org/), and if the update is being done after a Science Evaluation Panel meeting, there may be new results to consider (deactivation of proposals or progression from proposal to expedition). **Make sure you know if any deactivations or stage changeshave occurred recently, as you'll need to input this information manually in the code.**

You should end up with 3 new Excel files and can name them appropriately with the update date. Follow the KML conversion instructions to format the files correctly, then update the [website](https://www.iodp.org/resources/maps-and-kml-tools)!
